* Overview

This repository contains deployment configurations and infrastructure-as-code for the Semantest ecosystem. It provides production-ready deployment patterns for various platforms and scales.

* Repository History

** Monorepo Separation (2024-01-07)

This repository was extracted from the original chatgpt-buddy monorepo as part of Phase 8A of the Semantest platform evolution. The separation preserves the complete git history of the deploy directory.

*** Key Changes
- Extracted from =deploy/= directory in the monorepo
- Repository URL: https://github.com/semantest/deploy
- Part of the semantest organization
- Central deployment configuration repository

*** Post-Separation Setup Required
1. Update image references to use published containers
2. Set up GitHub Actions for deployment automation
3. Configure secrets management
4. Update documentation
